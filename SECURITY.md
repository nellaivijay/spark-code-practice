# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a practice environment for learning Apache Spark. Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Do NOT open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please use one of these methods:
- Open a private security advisory via GitHub's Security Advisory feature
- Send an email using the GitHub security contact form

Your report should include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested mitigation or fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- We will investigate the vulnerability and determine the severity
- We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure with you
- We will aim to patch the vulnerability within a reasonable timeframe
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you wish to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices for This Environment

### Development Environment

This is a **practice/learning environment** with simplified security configurations:

- Default credentials are used for convenience
- Authentication is disabled on some services
- Services are exposed on localhost for easy access
- No encryption for internal communications

### Production Deployment Considerations

If you adapt this environment for production use, you MUST:

1. **Change all default credentials**
   - MinIO credentials
   - Spark authentication
   - Database passwords
   - API keys and tokens

2. **Enable authentication**
   - Enable Spark authentication
   - Configure proper IAM policies
   - Use secrets management (Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
   - Implement network security policies

3. **Network security**
   - Use network policies in Kubernetes
   - Implement TLS/SSL for all endpoints
   - Restrict access to sensitive services
   - Use VPNs or private networks for internal communication

4. **Data encryption**
   - Enable encryption at rest for storage
   - Enable encryption in transit (TLS)
   - Use encrypted volumes
   - Secure sensitive data in memory

5. **Monitoring and logging**
   - Enable audit logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Implement log aggregation
   - Set up alerts for security events

### Current Security Limitations

This practice environment has the following known security limitations:

- **Hardcoded default credentials** in `.env.example` (for documentation purposes only)
- **No authentication** on Spark services (disabled for learning convenience)
- **No TLS/SSL** encryption for service communication
- **Open ports** on localhost without access controls
- **No secrets management** integration
- **No security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline

### Environment Variables

Never commit actual credentials to the repository. Use environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual credentials
# .env is listed in .gitignore and will not be committed
```

### Kubernetes Secrets

For Kubernetes deployments, use proper secrets management:

```bash
# Create secrets from environment variables
kubectl create secret generic spark-secrets \
  --from-literal=spark-password=$SPARK_PASSWORD \
  --from-literal=minio-access-key=$MINIO_ACCESS_KEY \
  --from-literal=minio-secret-key=$MINIO_SECRET_KEY \
  --namespace=spark-practice

# Or use a secrets manager like:
# - Kubernetes External Secrets Operator
# - AWS Secrets Manager
# - HashiCorp Vault
```

## Dependency Security

This project uses the following major dependencies:

- Apache Spark 3.5.0
- MinIO
- Python dependencies (PySpark, pandas, etc.)
- Docker

Keep these dependencies updated to benefit from security patches.

## Security Scanning

We recommend running security scans on your environment:

```bash
# Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
docker scan apache/spark:3.5.0
docker scan minio/minio:latest

# Scan Python dependencies
pip install safety
safety check

# Scan Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f k8s/
```
